# Arc Boost Collection
Warning: Work in progress (Mostly working)

Adapts colors of Google Calendar based on your Arc Browser theme.
## Usage/Install (Arc Browser only)
1. Open Google Calendar (calendar.google.com)
2. Press the `+` icon in the sidebar and click `New Boost`
3. Select Style boost
4. Remove pre-generated CSS and replace with styles.css

## Issues (probably more than what is listed here)
- Icon and Icon Buttons remain gray
- Weird coloring for left calendar (especially if dates selected span different months)
- Coloring for light themes are off
